# CircleMinigame
 NoPixel Based Lockpick from QBFramework

 This was created into a standalone minigame resource for all frameworks (ESX, OX, and QBCore)


# Template
exports['CircleMinigame']:StartLockPickCircle(amount, time, function(success)

# Example useage

>
RegisterCommand("lpgame", function()
	local time = math.random(7,10)
	local circles = math.random(2,4)
	local success = exports['CircleMinigame']:StartLockPickCircle(circles, time, success)
	print(success)
	if success then
		print("WIN")
	else
		print("FAIL")
	end
end)

# Amount of time to spin and amount of time to trigger are currently held within the js I am trying to export it to lua
# Amount and Time now work, but functioning success now doesn't go over to the export.
